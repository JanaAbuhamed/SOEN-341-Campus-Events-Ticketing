Campus Events &amp; Ticketing Web App for SOEN 341 Project

## Objective

The system is made in a way that students can easily browse, save, and attend events, simplifies the check-in processes through QR codes, and gives organizers tools to create, manage, and analyze their events. It also enables administrators to ensure smooth operations through content moderation and organizational oversight. Finally, the application aims to foster better involvement in the community, improve operational efficiency, and create a larger support system to on-campus events.
